  <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
  If you have a problem with any of these terms, they may be changed if discussed with me prior to paying for your commissioned piece.

 

  <h2>1. GENERAL TERMS</h2>
 
  <p>All drawings may or will include a subtle sign that you may not remove.</p>
 

<p>I might record the drawing process and post it on my youtube.</p>
 

<p>Prices are subject to change based on demand.</p>
 

<p>I have the right to reject any order that I do not feel comfortable drawing for any reason.</p>

<h2>2. PAYMENT</h2>
 
<p>Currency accepted is USD and can be paid through PayPal.</p> 
 

<p>Commissions can be paid either 100% upfront or split 50% upfront and 50% after sketch approval.</p>
 

<p>Don't send me payment before I have agreed to give you a slot and requested you to send me the payment.</p>


<h2>3. PROCESS AND DELIVERY</h2>
 
<p>I will notify you when I have started on your commission and you, therefore, lose the rights to a refund (see point 7 further below for more info on refunds)</p>
 

<p>While I'm working on your commission I will make reviews with you to make sure I make it just right for you!</p>
 

<p>The amount of reviews depends on the complexity of the work.</p>
 

<p>During the reviews, you will see work-in-progress and these images will usually include a watermark and be smaller than the finished piece.</p>
 

<p>The time it takes to finish your commission varies 1 week - 2 months depending on factors such as health, school, the complexity of the commissioned piece, and other work.</p>
 

<p>If anything comes up that will slow the progress of the initially estimated delivery time I will let you know asap.</p>
 

<p>Once the piece is finished you will receive the full-resolution image along with a web-friendly size. Note that there is no physical product. Depending on where you live, we can arrange to print your artwork. Just ask :)</p>
  

<h2>4. REVISIONS</h2>
 
<p>You get 3 rounds of changes on the commissioned piece included in the price.</p>
 

<p>A fee will be added if you want something changed on the final drawing - unless a misunderstanding from my side has been made.</p>
 

<p>If you wish for me to change something in the drawing you have previously approved, I will charge you a fee to change it. The amount of the extra charge depends on the change you want me to make and is usually based on an hourly wage.</p>
 

<p>If your reference is unclear to start with changes will come at an extra charge.</p>

<h2>5. COPYRIGHT / USAGE POLICY</h2>
 
<h3>I, Sadie (limesade), claim the rights to the produced drawing, not the buyer. Therefore I am allowed to use the copyrighted artwork to:</h3>


<p>Promote myself with it everywhere</p>
 

<p>Publish books with it (artbooks, etc.)</p>
 

<p>Display it everywhere to my liking (website, social media, etc.)</p>
 

<p>Post it wherever I want</p>
 

<h3>The buyer is allowed to:</h3>
 

<p>Use the commissioned piece for personal use unless agreed otherwise (you can upload it on all your social media profiles, forums, etc.)</p>
 

<p>Print the artwork and claim the character(s) as their own, but not the artwork itself.</p>
 

<p>Use the artwork to promote themselves. You are not forced to give me credit when you post it but it is very appreciated.</p>
 

<p>Use the artwork on their Youtube channel and in monetized videos as long as the artwork itself is not the main subject for the earnings.</p>
 


<h3>The following is considered copyright infringement:</h3>


<p>Reproducing/using the copyrighted artwork commercially - means making money off it in any way.</p>
 

<p>Claiming the artwork as your own</p>
 

<p>Removing my signature from the artwork</p>
 

<p>Altering the artwork without my consent</p>
 


<p>I reserve the full rights to the image and it's use/distribution unless otherwise agreed upon (rights to the image for your own non-personal use may be purchased at any time).</p>

  

<h2>6. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION</h2>
 
<p>I will do everything I can to make my customers happy!</p>
 

<p>If you have a problem with anything in regards to the commissioned piece please tell me right away so we can find a solution together.</p>
 

<p>I am willing to change some of my terms for you if you ask before I start on your commission. If you, e.g., do not want me to post your art anywhere, we can discuss this.</p>

<h2>7. REFUND / CANCELLATION POLICY</h2>
 
<p>The buyer is not allowed a refund once I started working on the commission.</p>
 

<p>If for any reason I am unable to start your commission you will receive a full refund.</p>
 

<p>If you cancel your order before I started it, you can get a full refund.</p>
 

<p>If you are getting a refund, do not request a Paypal chargeback. I will transfer the money back to you myself.</p>
 

<p>If you request a Paypal chargeback at any point when you were not allowed to ask for a refund you will lose all beforementioned rights to the commissioned piece and I will have the full right to profit further from it in any way. I will decline the chargeback and supply Paypal with our conversations in which we talk about the commission as evidence that I have completed work for you. Furthermore, you will be blacklisted for commissioning me again.</p>


<p>If the buyer breaks any of the points stated above they will lose all the beforementioned rights to the artwork commissioned by me, Sadie (limesade), and I will have the right to profit further from the commissioned artwork in any way I see fit. If you have a problem with any of these statements, they may be changed if discussed with me prior to paying your commissioned piece.</p>

<h2>What do you get?</h2>

<p>Drafts/mockups that you must decide which one I should continue with (depending on the complexity of the commission there might be fewer or more drafts)</p>
 

<p>Sketch and/or final sketches that you must accept before I continue the work</p>
 

<p>Insight and involvement in color plan (depending on the complexity of the commissioned piece)</p>
 

<p>Full-resolution file (approx. 210 x 297 mm at 300 DPI) of final drawing and a smaller version for internet upload. Final file formats are usually PNG.</p>
